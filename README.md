# Features
* **Interactive World Map:** Click on any country to receive a book recommendation from that nation’s literary tradition. The map acts as both a discovery tool and a visual progress tracker.
* **Dynamic Recommendations:** Save the current recommendation to your reading list or click **Next** to generate another suggestion instantly.
* **Reading List Management:** Saved books are organized into **Read** and **To Be Read** sections. Users can update a book’s status or remove it from their list.
* **Progress Counters:** The sidebar displays counters for books saved, books read, and total countries explored.
* **Book-to-Map Synchronization:** Each saved book updates the map’s visual state. Countries change color when added to the reading list and  once marked as read.
* **Dynamic Literature Visualization:** The app provides a global overview of the user’s literary journey, turning reading data into an interactive geographic experience.
